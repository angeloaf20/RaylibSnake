# Snake in raylib
I've been lacking in the fundamentals so I wanted to see how fast I could make snake game (roughly a day because I had to do some stuff in between). 
Didn't put too much thought into portability. Programmed this on a Windows machine.
The wall collisions are kind of janky but I don't care to fix that right now.
The game has a main and final menu. It saves your final score in a .txt file.

I was inspired to make this by this video:
